**First, [🍴 Fork This Repo](https://github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmauricegift%2Ftelegram-bot%2Ffork) to obtain your editable repository.**

### ⚙️ Configure the Bot:

### ☁️ Deployment Options

You can deploy your configured bot on various platforms:

-   **Deploy on [RENDER](https://dashboard.render.com/new)**

Follow other specific platform instructions to deploy your bot. (The author primarily uses Heroku).

## 🛠️ Usage

To interact with the bot, users can send commands and messages. The bot will respond based on its features and functionality. Here are some examples:

-   `/menu` or `/start` - Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.
-   And Many Other Commands - Use the bot to discover them yourself!

### 🎨 HERE'S MENU STYLE
*(The original README mentioned an image for the menu style. In Markdown, you would typically embed an image like this if you have a URL: `![Menu Preview](URL_TO_IMAGE)`. Since I cannot generate or assume image URLs, I'm noting its original intent here. You can describe the menu or link to an image if you have one.)*
